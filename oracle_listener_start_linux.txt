TNS-12505: TNS:listener does not currently know of SID given in connect descriptor
ora-12514 listener does not currently know of service requested in connect descriptor

If the database isn't running, though, nothing will have registered the service, so you shouldn't expect the listener to know about it - lsnrctl status or lsnrctl services won't report a service that isn't registered yet.
sqlplus /nolog
Then from the SQL*Plus prompt:

connect / as sysdba
startup
